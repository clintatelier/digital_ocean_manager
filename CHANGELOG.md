# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2023-06-15

### Added
- Created CHANGELOG.md to track project changes and improvements

### Changed
- Updated requirements.txt to include additional necessary packages for Kubernetes management

### Removed
- Deleted outdated `initial_cluster_setup.py` script
- Removed `add_new_application.py` script as it's no longer relevant to the Kubernetes-based architecture

## [1.0.0] - 2023-06-14

### Added
- Implemented Kubernetes-based architecture for deploying and managing applications
- Created scripts for initial Kubernetes cluster setup (initial_setup.py)
- Developed deployment scripts for web apps (deploy_web_app.py)
- Developed deployment scripts for static sites (deploy_static_site.py)
- Created build and preparation script for mobile apps (deploy_mobile_app.py)
- Added Dockerfile templates for web apps and static sites
- Implemented Kubernetes manifest generation for deployments, services, and ingress
- Updated README.md with comprehensive instructions for the new setup
- Created project_summary.md with an overview of the project structure and components

### Changed
- Refactored the project to use a single Kubernetes cluster for all resources
- Updated the deployment process to use DigitalOcean's container registry
- Modified the mobile app deployment process to focus on building and preparation for app store submission

### Removed
- Eliminated individual droplet-based deployment methods
- Removed outdated scripts and configurations

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. Implement automated testing for deployment scripts and Kubernetes manifests
2. Add support for blue-green deployments and canary releases
3. Integrate a monitoring and logging solution (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana)
4. Implement auto-scaling policies for the Kubernetes cluster
5. Add support for database migrations and backups
6. Enhance security measures, such as implementing network policies and secret management
7. Create a web-based dashboard for managing deployments and viewing application status
8. Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
9. Add support for additional programming languages and frameworks
10. Implement cost optimization strategies, such as using spot instances for non-critical workloads

## Known Issues

- The current setup assumes a single Kubernetes cluster. For larger organizations, consider implementing multi-cluster support.
- Mobile app deployment is limited to building and preparation. Consider integrating with app store APIs for automated submissions.
- The system currently doesn't handle database management. Consider adding support for database creation and management within the Kubernetes cluster.

## Current Project State

The DigitalOcean Manager now provides a comprehensive solution for managing and deploying various types of applications (web apps, static sites, and mobile apps) using a Kubernetes-based architecture on DigitalOcean. The project includes:

1. Initial setup script for creating and configuring a Kubernetes cluster
2. Deployment scripts for web applications and static sites
3. Build and preparation script for mobile applications
4. Dockerfile templates for web apps and static sites
5. Configuration files for different environments
6. Comprehensive documentation including README.md and project_summary.md

The project is now streamlined for Kubernetes-based deployments, offering improved scalability and resource management. Users can easily set up a Kubernetes cluster, deploy applications, and manage their DigitalOcean resources through a unified interface.

Please refer to the README.md and project_summary.md files for detailed information on how to use the DigitalOcean Manager with its Kubernetes-based architecture.
